## ðŸ”¥ Overview
FastAvatar is a **feedforward** 3D avatar framework capable of flexibly leveraging diverse daily recordings (e.g., a single image, multi-view observations, or monocular video) to reconstruct a high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model **within seconds**, using only a single **unified** model.

## ðŸŽ‰ Core Highlights 
- **Unified Model with Flexible Multi-frame Aggregation for Ultra-high-fidelity Avatars**
- **Fast Feedforward Framework Delivering High-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting Models in Seconds**
- **Incremental 3D Avatar Reconstruction Leveraging Diverse Inputs (single-shot, monocular and multi-view)**
