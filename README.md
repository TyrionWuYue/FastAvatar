## ðŸ”¥ Overview
FastAvatar is a **feedforward** 3D avatar framework capable of flexibly leveraging diverse daily recordings (e.g., a single image, multi-view observations, or monocular video) to reconstruct a high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model **within seconds**, using only a single **unified** model.
